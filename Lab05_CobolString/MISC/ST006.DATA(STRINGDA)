A CHARACTER ENCODING UNIT (OR ENCODING UNIT) IS A SINGLE CODE POINT IN A00010000
CODED CHARACTER SET. FOR A SINGLE-BYTE EBCDIC CHARACTER SET, AN ENCODING00020000
UNIT IS A BYTE.  FOR AN EBCDIC DOUBLE-BYTE CHARACTER SET, AN ENCODING   00030000
UNIT IS TWO BYTES.  FOR EBCDIC AND ASCII CHARACTER SETS, A GRAPHIC      00040000
CHARACTER IS ALWAYS REPRESENTED IN A SINGLE ENCODING UNIT, AND USERS    00050000
NEED NOT CONSIDER ENCODING UNITS.                                       00060000
IN UNICODE UTF-16, A CHARACTER                                          00070000
ENCODING UNIT CONSISTS OF TWO BYTES. MANY UTF-16 CHARACTERS ARE         00080000
REPRESENTED IN ONE ENCODING UNIT. ANY CHARACTERS CONVERTED TO UTF-16    00090000
FROM A SINGLE-BYTE OR DOUBLE-BYTE EBCDIC OR ASCII CODE PAGE, FOR        00100000
EXAMPLE, ARE EACH REPRESENTED IN ONE ENCODING UNIT. HOWEVER, A SUBSET OF00110000
THE CHARACTERS IN UTF-16 ARE REPRESENTED IN TWO OR MORE ENCODING UNITS. 00120000
SOME GRAPHIC CHARACTERS ARE REPRESENTED BY A SURROGATE PAIR, CONSISTING 00130000
OF TWO ENCODING UNITS (FOUR BYTES). OTHERS ARE REPRESENTED BY A         00140000
COMPOSITE                                                               00150000
SEQUENCE, CONSISTING OF A BASE CHARACTER AND ONE OR MORE COMBINING MARKS00160000
(FOUR BYTES OR MORE, IN TWO-BYTE INCREMENTS).                           00170000
IN THE RULES OF ENTERPRISE                                              00180000
COBOL, THE TERMS "CHARACTER" AND "CHARACTER POSITION" REFER TO A SINGLE 00190000
ENCODING UNIT. IN MOST CASES, THIS IS THE SAME AS A GRAPHIC CHARACTER.  00200000
WHEN DATA CONTAINS SURROGATE PAIRS OR COMPOSITE SEQUENCES, PROGRAMMERS  00210000
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT OPERATIONS ON NATIONAL CHARACTERS DO  00220000
NOT UNINTENTIONALLY SEPARATE THE MULTIPLE ENCODING UNITS THAT FORM A    00230000
GRAPHIC CHARACTER.  CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH REFERENCE MODIFICATION,   00240000
AND TRUNCATION DURING MOVES SHOULD BE AVOIDED. THE COBOL RUNTIME SYSTEM 00250000
DOES NOT CHECK FOR A SPLIT BETWEEN THE ENCODING UNITS THAT FORM A       00260000
GRAPHIC CHARACTER.                                                      00270000
