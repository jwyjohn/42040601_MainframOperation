00001     A CHARACTER ENCODING UNIT (OR ENCODING UNIT) IS A SINGLE CODE POINT IN
00002     CODED CHARACTER SET. FOR A SINGLE-BYTE EBCDIC CHARACTER SET, AN ENCODI
00003     UNIT IS A BYTE.  FOR AN EBCDIC DOUBLE-BYTE CHARACTER SET, AN ENCODING 
00004     UNIT IS TWO BYTES.  FOR EBCDIC AND ASCII CHARACTER SETS, A GRAPHIC    
00005     CHARACTER IS ALWAYS REPRESENTED IN A SINGLE ENCODING UNIT, AND USERS  
00006     NEED NOT CONSIDER ENCODING UNITS.                                     
00007     IN UNICODE UTF-16, A CHARACTER                                        
00008     ENCODING UNIT CONSISTS OF TWO BYTES. MANY UTF-16 CHARACTERS ARE       
00009     REPRESENTED IN ONE ENCODING UNIT. ANY CHARACTERS CONVERTED TO UTF-16  
00010     FROM A SINGLE-BYTE OR DOUBLE-BYTE EBCDIC OR ASCII CODE PAGE, FOR      
00011     EXAMPLE, ARE EACH REPRESENTED IN ONE ENCODING UNIT. HOWEVER, A SUBSET 
00012     THE CHARACTERS IN UTF-16 ARE REPRESENTED IN TWO OR MORE ENCODING UNITS
00013     SOME GRAPHIC CHARACTERS ARE REPRESENTED BY A SURROGATE PAIR, CONSISTIN
00014     OF TWO ENCODING UNITS (FOUR BYTES). OTHERS ARE REPRESENTED BY A       
00015     COMPOSITE                                                             
00016     SEQUENCE, CONSISTING OF A BASE CHARACTER AND ONE OR MORE COMBINING MAR
00017     (FOUR BYTES OR MORE, IN TWO-BYTE INCREMENTS).                         
00018     IN THE RULES OF ENTERPRISE                                            
00019     COBOL, THE TERMS "CHARACTER" AND "CHARACTER POSITION" REFER TO A SINGL
00020     ENCODING UNIT. IN MOST CASES, THIS IS THE SAME AS A GRAPHIC CHARACTER.
00021     WHEN DATA CONTAINS SURROGATE PAIRS OR COMPOSITE SEQUENCES, PROGRAMMERS
00022     ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT OPERATIONS ON NATIONAL CHARACTERS DO
00023     NOT UNINTENTIONALLY SEPARATE THE MULTIPLE ENCODING UNITS THAT FORM A  
00024     GRAPHIC CHARACTER.  CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH REFERENCE MODIFICATION, 
00025     AND TRUNCATION DURING MOVES SHOULD BE AVOIDED. THE COBOL RUNTIME SYSTE
00026     DOES NOT CHECK FOR A SPLIT BETWEEN THE ENCODING UNITS THAT FORM A     
00027     GRAPHIC CHARACTER.
